# Executive Summary
In this project, we observe the categorical differences in priorities between business school programs and the industry regarding analytics skills. In scope there is alignment; however, this project quantifies the difference in priority, identifying key areas where academic programs could optimize, by either reducing or adding courses to match industry needs.

This study recommends that Jones Graduate School of Business at Rice University build analytics skills fundamentally into existing courses, bridging the gap by raising existing curriculum.

* Incorporate state of the art visualization tools in other quantitative classes.
* Business communication expands in data visualization.
* ILE’s for application of data analytics in energy, healthcare.

Highlighting the 29 skills listed above and for the topics that are the most salient, it is our recommendation to emphasize in existing classes. Consider the top five analytics skills requested of MBA graduates. Each of these could have natural homes in courses already offered at Jones.

* Optimization in Data Analysis
* Big Data and other data storage types as an ILE
* Social Media in Marketing
* Forecasting in Data Analysis
* Econometrics in Economics
